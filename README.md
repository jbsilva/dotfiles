# Dotfiles

Those are the files I use to configure my computers. As I have more than one
computer, I've created a branch for each one of them:

- `macbook_osx`: My MacBook Air running OS X
- `macbook_arch`: My MacBook Air running Arch Linux
- `acer_arch`: My Acer notebook running Arch Linux
- `hp`: My old HP desktop running Arch Linux
